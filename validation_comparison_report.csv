Verify detailed chapters exist for every risk parameter (PD, LGD, EAD, FLI).;"Based on the provided context, the following evidence can be cited regarding the formal controls and procedures to ensure that IFRS 9 methodologies are applied consistently and traceably:

1. The **Directorate** is responsible for ensuring that the bank has an adequate framework that is effective, viable, and consistent for determining expected credit losses over the lifetime of financial instruments. This includes approving the model for estimating the impairment of financial assets, which must align with the requirements of IFRS 9 (Point 5.5) (Page 2).

2. The **Risk and Compliance Management** is tasked with participating in the development of the impairment estimation model, which must be reviewed at least annually or whenever events occur that could alter the adopted methodology (Page 3).

3. The **Risk Management** department is also involved in the development of the impairment estimation model, ensuring it aligns with IFRS 9 requirements and is subject to regular review (Page 3).

4. There is a commitment to send an updated manual of procedures and documentation justifying the analysis after meetings of the Risk Management and Compliance Committee, indicating a structured approach to documentation and traceability (Page 4).

5. The entity acknowledges the need for an **Independent Validation** of the model developed for estimating Expected Credit Losses (ECL), as per the guidelines from the Central Bank and Basel Committee, which further supports the existence of formal controls (Page 6).

6. The entity is in advanced discussions with an external provider specialized in model validations to ensure the review is conducted independently, which indicates a formalized process for ensuring compliance with IFRS 9 (Page 6).

In summary, the context provides evidence of formal controls and procedures in place to ensure that IFRS 9 methodologies are applied consistently and traceably, as outlined in the responsibilities of the Directorate and various management departments, along with commitments to documentation and independent validation.";10;The AI Generated Answer accurately cites multiple points from the provided context, including the responsibilities of the Directorate and Risk Management, the commitment to documentation, and the need for independent validation.

1. **Clarity and Structure**: The context mentions that the entity has committed to sending updated manuals and documentation to justify their analyses and methodologies (e.g., the manual of procedures with modifications is to be sent after publication on 31/08/2025, Page 0). However, it does not provide specific details on how the documentation will be structured or what it will contain to ensure clarity for an external party.

2. **Assumptions Documentation**: While there are references to assumptions being made (e.g., regarding the Probability of Default and the methodology changes), the context does not explicitly state that these assumptions are clearly documented in a manner that would be easily understandable to an external party (Page 8).

3. **Versioning and Last Revision**: The context does not provide information regarding versioning or the last revision of the documents. It mentions commitments to send updated manuals and documentation but does not specify how version control will be managed or what the last revision dates are (Not Documented in provided context).

In summary, while there are commitments to improve documentation, the current state does not meet the criteria for clarity, structure, and comprehensive understanding for an independent third party. Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer**: No, the documentation is not written in a clear, structured, and comprehensive manner for an independent third party to fully understand and replicate the process without relying on internal knowledge.

16.0;1;Segmentation;3.1;Does segmentation adequately distinguish between collective and individual treatment, where applicable?;Test 3.1: Review the Segmentation Policy. Verify that clear, mutually exclusive criteria (whether quantitative thresholds, specific risk characteristics, or lack of historical data) are defined to assign exposures to either Individual or Collective assessment.;"The segmentation adequately distinguishes between collective and individual treatment as follows:

1. **Collective Treatment**: The context specifies that for ""Tratamiento Colectivo,"" criteria are defined to determine if a group of homogeneous assets can be considered as an independent segment. The criteria include different payment behaviors, particular forms of instrumentation, and representing a significant portion of the portfolio (Page 3).

2. **Individual Treatment**: The context outlines that ""Tratamiento Individual"" involves an individual analysis of new and unusual active operations that lack a payment history justifying an objective analysis of collectability. These operations are separated until sufficient observations are available to transition them to collective treatment (Page 3).

3. **Specific Cases**: It is noted that individual treatment is applied to clients with operations not settled in the loan application system and those with special operations analyzed by the Credit Risk sector to determine their Probability of Default (PD) (Page 3).

4. **Segmentation Methodology**: The methodology for creating homogeneous segments is detailed, indicating that operations are initially separated into individual treatment and then further segmented based on specific criteria (Page 4).

Did they check if segments are still distinct?";"The context provides a detailed description of the segmentation process for the portfolio, specifically under the section ""4.1 Segmentación de la cartera"" (Page 4). It outlines the criteria for both individual and collective treatment of assets, indicating a defined process for determining segmentation based on various factors such as payment behavior, specific characteristics of the instruments, and the significance of the portfolio portion.

Additionally, the context mentions that the classification of assets is updated monthly based on the condition of all active operations, which implies a review process that could be both quantitative (based on numerical data) and qualitative (based on the assessment of individual circumstances).

However, while the context describes the segmentation and classification processes, it does not explicitly state a formalized process for reviewing the segmentation in terms of homogeneity/heterogeneity, concentration, or stability.

Therefore, the answer to the audit query is:

**Answer:** The context outlines a segmentation process based on specific criteria (Page 4), but it does not explicitly define a formalized process for reviewing segmentation in terms of homogeneity/heterogeneity, concentration, or stability. Thus, the process is not fully documented in the provided context.";8;The AI Generated Answer accurately references the segmentation process outlined in the context, specifically mentioning the criteria for individual and collective treatment of assets. It correctly identifies that the classification of assets is updated monthly, indicating a review process. However, it notes the absence of a formalized process for reviewing segmentation in terms of homogeneity/heterogeneity, concentration, or stability, which is a critical aspect of the audit query.

1. **Default Definition**: The context states that a default is considered when there is an overdue of more than 90 days (Page 6). This definition is consistently referenced in relation to the categorization of exposures into different stages (Stage 2 and Stage 3).

2. **Staging**: The classification of clients into Stage 2 is based on adverse classifications in the Central de Deudores and other criteria, even if there is no overdue (Page 6). This aligns with the definition of default as it incorporates external signals of credit deterioration.

3. **Probability of Default (PD)**: The methodology for estimating PD is based on historical default frequencies and is consistent with the definition of default (Page 9). The context mentions that the PD is determined by segmenting the portfolios and observing the frequency of default, which is in line with the established definition.

4. **Loss Given Default (LGD)**: The context indicates that the LGD is calculated based on the parameters of exposure and loss intensity, and it is noted that the risk associated with certain operations has already been incorporated into the PD, avoiding duplication (Page 2). This shows a consistent application of the default definition in the calculation of LGD.

5. **Overall Consistency**: The context emphasizes that the definition of default is consistent with the categorization of exposures and the methodologies for calculating PD and LGD, ensuring that all components of the model are aligned with the same definition of default (Page 9).

The methodology allows for the classification of other operations of the same client into a higher stage (Stage 2 or Stage 3) if one operation is classified as such, even if the other operations do not meet the individual criteria for transfer. This approach recognizes the interconnectedness of a client's financial situation and anticipates greater risk at the client level, which is a common practice in credit risk management to mitigate potential losses.

The context states: ""Este enfoque permite reconocer situaciones donde el deterioro parcial anticipa un riesgo mayor a nivel cliente"" (This approach allows recognizing situations where partial deterioration anticipates a greater risk at the client level) [Page 3]. This indicates a proactive stance in managing credit risk, which is consistent with best practices.

1. **Data Sources**: The context mentions that the PD is based on historical default rates and that a weighted average PD of the portfolio is considered ([Page 17]). However, specific data sources are not explicitly detailed.

2. **Horizon**: The context states that a maximum analysis horizon of 60 months is used for determining default probabilities, which is consistent with the observed behavior of portfolios ([Page 8]).

3. **Statistical Technique**: The methodology for estimating PD is described as being based on cases (individual exposures) rather than amounts, which aligns with statistical principles. However, the specific statistical techniques employed are not detailed in the provided context ([Page 6]).

4. **Target Population**: The context indicates that the PD is determined by segment, observing the frequency of default over historical portfolios of the same segment ([Page 8]). However, the specific characteristics of the target population are not elaborated upon.

5. **Assumptions**: The context mentions that the PD calculation should reflect current economic conditions (point-in-time approach) and that the methodology should be adjusted to avoid assigning a PD of 0% ([Page 9]).

1. The methodology for determining the lifetime PD is based on constructing a default curve that captures the accumulated probabilities of default from a portfolio, from the analysis date until the portfolio's extinction. This is consistent with the expected life of exposures as it considers the entire duration of the exposure (Page 8).

2. The context specifies that for Stage 2, the PD is calculated using the formula: EAD x (PD (Lifetime) x FL) x LGD, which indicates that the lifetime PD is indeed a critical component of the expected credit loss calculation for exposures classified in Stage 2 (Page 8).

3. The explanation of the lifetime PD aligns with the staging approach, as it differentiates between Stage 1 (12-month PD) and Stage 2 (lifetime PD), thus demonstrating a clear understanding of how the PD estimation relates to the staging of credit exposures (Page 8).

The context explains that the PD is determined by segmenting the data and observing the frequency of default over historical portfolios, with a maximum analysis horizon of 60 months due to the absence of portfolios with longer residual maturities. The document states that a default curve is constructed to capture accumulated probabilities of default from the date of analysis until the extinction of the portfolio, and an average of the last 36 historical curves is taken to obtain a single average curve per segment (Page 8).

Additionally, it mentions that the average default curve represents the expected evolution of default during the residual term of the portfolio, with specific points corresponding to the 12-month and lifetime probabilities of default (Page 9). 

However, the context also indicates that there is a recommendation to adjust the methodology to ensure the correct estimation of PD in accordance with IFRS principles and international best practices (Page 8).

3. The context also indicates that the average of the last 36 historical default curves is used to determine the PD for both 12 months and lifetime, and that the average omits the last 6 observations due to the reliance on estimated values in recent months.

1. **Staging Criteria for SICR**: The context outlines that a significant increase in credit risk is defined as a situation where an operation has a delay of more than 30 days. This is the primary criterion for categorizing an operation into Stage 2 (Page 5).

2. **Additional Criteria for SICR**: The entity has established additional criteria for determining SICR beyond the 30-day delay, which include:
   - The application of a ""contagion of stage"" methodology among operations of the same client, where if one operation is classified in Stage 2 or Stage 3, other operations of the same client may also be reclassified (Page 3).
   - Inclusion of clients in a preventive bankruptcy procedure, which will automatically reclassify related operations to at least Stage 2, regardless of current payment behavior (Page 3).
   - Consideration of the client's classification in the Central de Deudores, where a risk category higher than the internal classification may lead to Stage 2 classification (Page 3).

3. **Documentation and Analysis**: The definition of SICR must be supported by a specific analysis of the portfolio and documented in the Manual de Previsionamiento, as per the guidelines established in point B5.5.17 of IFRS 9 (Page 2).

4. **Implementation Timeline**: The context indicates that the additional parameters for SICR will be included in the calculations starting from September 2025, with a commitment to send the updated Manual of Procedures by October 31, 2025 (Page 3).

5. **Review and Approval Process**: The model for estimating credit risk deterioration must be reviewed at least annually and approved by the Board, ensuring that the criteria and thresholds are consistently applied (Page 2).

In summary, the audit test procedure can be supported by the evidence that the entity has defined specific criteria for SICR, including both primary and additional factors, and has established a process for documentation and review.

1. **Segmentation Criteria**: The context outlines specific criteria for determining whether a group of homogeneous assets can be considered as an independent segment. These criteria include different payment behaviors, particular forms of instrumentation, and the representation of a significant portion of the portfolio (Page 3).

2. **Current Segmentation**: The current segmentation includes various categories such as ""Banca Empresas,"" which encompasses all types of operations exclusive to commercial portfolio clients. Additionally, it mentions the classification of assets into ""Tratamiento Individual"" and ""Tratamiento Colectivo,"" indicating that different methodologies are applied based on the nature of the assets (Page 4).

3. **Homogeneity Tests**: The methodology for creating segments of homogeneous operations is described, indicating that operations are initially separated into different categories before applying selection criteria for assignment to segments.

4. The document mentions the need for independent validation of the model developed for estimating Expected Credit Losses, which is consistent with supervisory guidelines that emphasize the importance of model validation (Page 4).
5. The methodology also considers forward-looking information, which is a requirement under IFRS 9 for the estimation of expected credit losses (Page 8).

Overall, the evidence suggests that the ECL methodology is designed to meet the requirements of IFRS 9 and relevant supervisory guidelines.";10;The AI Generated Answer accurately references specific points from the provided context, including adherence to IFRS 9 (Point 5.5), the formula for Expected Credit Loss (PCE), the review process for the model, the need for independent validation, and the consideration of forward-looking information.

61.0;2;ECL Calculation;11.6;Does the book include POCIs? How are they treated? Are they correctly recognised?;"Test 11.6: Search for POCI flag. Ensure they do not have a ""Stage 1"" but are tracked as POCI from Day 1.";Not Documented in provided context.;0;The AI Generated Answer states that the information is 'Not Documented in provided context,' which is incorrect. The context provides detailed information about the treatment of credit losses and classifications under NIIF 9, which implies that POCIs (Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired financial assets) are relevant to the discussion. Therefore, the answer does not accurately reflect the evidence in the context.;Page 5, Page 2, Page 7, Page 9, Page 2;"Sí.
