#;Tier (1/2/3);Scope;Control Reference;Design Effectiveness Assessment;Test Procedures 
1;1;Model Governance and Oversight;1.1;Is there a formal policy for the calculation of Expected Credit Loss / IFRS 9 approved by Senior Management or the governing body?;Test 1.1: Obtain the IFRS 9 Policy. Verify the approval date and signature. Confirm it was approved by the Board or ALCO.
2;1;Model Governance and Oversight;1.2;Are the IFRS 9 policy and procedures aligned with the requirements of the applicable standard and local regulation?;Test 1.2: Review Policy 'Scope' and 'Definitions'. Confirm explicit references to IFRS 9 para 5.5 and relevant local circulars.
3;1;Model Governance and Oversight;1.3;Are there formal controls and procedures to ensure that IFRS 9 methodologies are applied consistently and traceably?;Test 1.3: Review the Methodological Manual. Verify detailed chapters exist for every risk parameter (PD, LGD, EAD, FLI).
5;1;Model Governance and Oversight;1.5;Are the roles and responsibilities of the IFRS 9 process (development, validation, business, reporting, etc.) clearly defined and documented?;Test 1.5: Review (if there is) 'Roles & Responsibilities' section. Verify that the team developing the model is different from the team validating it.
9;1;Data Quality and Sources;2.1;Representativeness testing performed? Data used is relevant e.g., using MEVs that are relevant to the portfolio in hand?;Test 2.1: Check the date range of training data. Does it include a downturn/crisis period?
16;1;Segmentation;3.1;Does segmentation adequately distinguish between collective and individual treatment, where applicable?;Test 3.1: Review the Segmentation Policy. Verify that clear, mutually exclusive criteria (whether quantitative thresholds, specific risk characteristics, or lack of historical data) are defined to assign exposures to either Individual or Collective assessment.
17;1;Segmentation;3.2;Is there a defined process (quantitative and/or qualitative) to determine and review segmentation (homogeneity/heterogeneity, concentration, stability, etc.)?;"Test 3.2: Request the last ""Segmentation Review"" report. Did they check if segments are still distinct?"
18;1;Segmentation;3.6;Is the segmentation quantitativelly backed  ?;"Test 3.6: Request the last ""Segmentation Review"" report. Did they check if segments are still distinct?"
21;1;Definition of Default;4.1;Is the definition of default documented and consistent with the reference regulation (e.g., more than 90 days past due, unlikeliness-to-pay criteria, etc.)?;"Test 4.1: Verify Policy text explicitly mentions ""90 days"" and lists UTP triggers (bankruptcy, restructuring)."
22;1;Definition of Default;4.2;Is the default definition applied consistently across staging, PD, LGD, and other model components?;Test 4.2: Compare the Default definition in the IFRS 9 Manual vs. the Basel/Capital Manual. They should match.
23;1;Risk Contagion;5.1;Is there a formal policy or criterion for risk contagion among exposures of the same client or economic group?;"Test 5.1: Review Policy. Look for the ""Pulling Effect"" rule (e.g., if 20% of exposure is default, all is default)."
25;1;Risk Contagion;5.3;Are there controls or periodic reviews to verify that stage contagion is correctly applied in practice?;Test 5.3: Identify a client with one defaulted loan. Check if their other performing loans are flagged as Stage 3.
26;1;PD;6.1;Is the PD estimation methodology clearly documented (data sources, horizon, statistical technique, target population, assumptions)?;Test 6.1: Verify the document explains how the PD is calculated step-by-step (Formulas, Variables).
27;1;PD;6.2;Is the PD model designed as Point-in-Time (PiT) or Through-the-Cycle (TTC), and is this choice justified against expected loss requirements?;Test 6.2: Check if the PD fluctuates with the economic cycle (Variable Scalar or FLI overlay). TTC is invalid for IFRS 9.
28;1;PD;6.3;Is lifetime PD estimation well explained and consistent with the expected life of exposures and staging approach?;Test 6.3: Review the marginal PD calculation. Does it account for prepayments and natural maturity?
30;1;PD;6.5;Are stability, sensitivity, or backtesting analyses available to support model calibration and performance?;"Test 6.5: Review the latest Backtesting Report. Look for ""Red/Amber/Green"" status on PD calibration."
32;1;LGD;7.1;Is the segmentation used for LGD (e.g., by product type, collateral, client type) defined and supported by empirical or business analysis?;"Test 7.1: Verify LGD is not ""one size fits all"". Expect different LGDs for Secured vs Unsecured."
34;1;LGD;7.3;Are recovery cash flows discounted using an appropriate rate (e.g., effective interest rate – EIR – or another duly justified rate) in line with applicable standards?;"Test 7.3: Verify the discount rate used. If ""Risk Free Rate"" is used, it's a finding. Must be EIR."
36;1;LGD;7.5;Are total loss assumptions (e.g., LGD of 100% after a certain time or condition) reasonably justified and documented?;"Test 7.5: Check policy for ""Write-off"" rules. Are assets >2 years past due provisioned at 100%?"
38;1;LGD;7.7;Are there controls to ensure recovery data quality and correct application of LGD methodology?;
40;1;EAD / CCF;8.1;Is there a clear definition and methodology for calculating EAD, including on- and off-balance sheet components where applicable?;"Test 8.1: Review EAD Formula. Must include ""Off-Balance Sheet"" component."
41;1;EAD / CCF;8.2;Are credit conversion factors (CCF) defined for off-balance sheet exposures and revolving products, where relevant?;Test 8.2: Check CCF table. Are there CCFs for Credit Cards, Overdrafts, and Guarantees?
45;1;EAD / CCF;8.6;Are there controls to check EAD calculation for multi-currency facilities?;Test 8.6: Check if FX rates are applied correctly to EAD for foreign currency loans.
48;1;Macro Scenarios;9.3;Does the FLI approach include multiple plausible macroeconomic scenarios (e.g., base, adverse, optimistic), or is their absence adequately justified?;Test 9.3: Verify the Provisioning Report shows 3 distinct ECL results weighted together.
50;1;Forward-Looking Information;10.1;Is there a formal process for selecting, developing, and validating the macroeconomic model or approach used to incorporate forward-looking information?;Test 10.1: Review the FLI Model Validation Report. Look for stationarity and cointegration tests.
56;1;ECL Calculation;11.1;Is the integration of PD, LGD, EAD, and FLI in ECL calculation clearly specified and implemented for each stage?;Test 11.1: Re-calculate one loan's ECL in Excel using the inputs. Match to system result.
57;1;ECL Calculation;11.2;Does ECL calculation respect Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 definitions (e.g., 12-month vs lifetime horizon, treatment of default exposures)?;"Test 11.2: Check the ""Horizon"" parameter in the engine for Stage 2 loans. Must be > 12 months."
58;1;ECL Calculation;11.3;Staging criteria and thresholds for significant increase in credit risk (SICR), Thorough assessment of SICR criteria and application. Test on Sample basis on loan tapes.;Test 11.3: Check a loan with 40 DPD. Is it Stage 2? If it is Stage 1, is there a valid rebuttal?
60;1;ECL Calculation;11.5;Is the overall ECL methodology consistent with expected loss standard requirements and relevant supervisory guidelines?;Test 11.5: (General) confirm the final booking includes the weighted average of scenarios.
63;1;Model Monitoring;12.1;Are there processes and controls for continuous monitoring of model risk to detect performance deterioration or significant changes in the environment?;"Test 12.1: Review the ""Model Monitoring Package"". Look for PSI (Population Stability Index) charts."
65;1;Model Overrides;13.1;Is there a formal policy defining when and how model overrides can be applied (e.g., thresholds, exceptional circumstances)?;Test 13.1: Review Policy. Does it set caps/limits on overrides? (e.g., max 5% of portfolio).
66;1;Model Overrides;13.2;Are all overrides documented with clear justification, supporting evidence, and approval from an independent authority?;"Test 13.2: Select a sample of 5 recent overrides (Post-Model Adjustments). Inspect the ""Credit Committee"" or ""Risk Committee"" minutes to find the specific approval for these adjustments."
