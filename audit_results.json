This is based on the observation that there are no portfolios with residual maturities exceeding this limit, which supports the choice of the 60-month horizon as appropriate for the analysis (Page 9).\n\n2. Additionally, for the calculation of Loss Given Default (LGD), the context mentions that the behavior of credits in default is evaluated concerning their recovery over ranges of delinquency. It specifies that credits in default are considered those with delays exceeding 90 days, which aligns with the historical behavior of recoveries (Page 11).\n\n3. The context also indicates that the average of the last 36 historical default curves is used to determine the PD for both 12 months and lifetime, and that the average omits the last 6 observations due to the reliance on estimated values in recent months. This iterative process of identifying the most significant historical range further supports the justification of the observation horizon (Page 9).\n\nIn conclusion, the observation horizon is justified and consistent with historical exposure behavior as it is based on empirical data and aligns with the defined criteria for measuring recoveries and losses.",
