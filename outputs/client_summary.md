# Executive Summary

## 1. Model Governance and Oversight
The governance structure for credit risk management includes the Gerencia de Riesgo y Cumplimiento and the Gerencia de Riesgo Crediticio, which collaborate on the development and annual review of the financial asset impairment estimation model. The Board of Directors is responsible for approving the model and its parameters, ensuring compliance with IFRS 9 and Basel III standards.

## 2. Data Quality and Sources
Data inputs for the credit risk models are derived from historical performance of portfolios, with a maximum analysis horizon of 60 months. The data quality is ensured through rigorous controls, although specific quality control measures are not documented.

## 3. Segmentation
The portfolio is segmented based on historical default frequencies and client classifications, particularly distinguishing between individual and corporate clients. This segmentation aids in the tailored assessment of Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).

## 4. Definition of Default
Default is defined as a situation where a client has a payment delay exceeding 90 days. Additionally, clients classified as having a risk category above the internal threshold are automatically categorized as Stage 2, regardless of their payment status.

## 5. Risk Contagion
Not Documented.

## 6. PD (Probability of Default)
The PD is estimated using historical default frequencies from segmented portfolios, with a focus on individual cases rather than amounts. The methodology incorporates a 12-month and lifetime PD calculation, averaging the last 36 historical default curves to derive a comprehensive PD estimate.

## 7. LGD (Loss Given Default)
LGD is calculated based on the recovery rates from defaulted loans, segmented into individual and corporate portfolios. A 100% LGD is applied for accounts overdue by more than 480 days, ensuring full provisioning when accounts are moved to off-balance sheet status.

## 8. EAD / CCF (Exposure at Default / Credit Conversion Factor)
EAD is determined as the accounting balance at the calculation date, including principal and accrued interest. The CCF for revolving credit products is guided by Basel standards, typically ranging from 10% to 75%, although specific calculations for off-balance sheet exposures are not detailed.

## 9. Macro Scenarios
Not Documented.

## 10. Forward-Looking Information
The policy incorporates forward-looking information primarily in the PD estimation process. However, it is recommended to enhance the forward-looking adjustments to include additional factors beyond PD.

## 11. ECL Calculation
The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is calculated using the formula: EAD x (PD x FL) x LGD, with distinct calculations for different stages of asset classification (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3).

## 12. Model Monitoring
Not Documented.

## 13. Model Overrides
The policy allows for expert judgment overrides in the model, particularly in the context of individual treatment assessments, where a model based on ten criteria is applied to determine the risk stage and expected loss. Adjustments are made to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and to reflect the current risk environment.
