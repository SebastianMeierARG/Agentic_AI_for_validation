All facts have been verified as present in the provided context.";"Yes, the audit procedures align with the requirements of IFRS 9. The model for estimating credit losses is reviewed at least annually or when significant events occur, ensuring compliance with the regulatory framework [Page 2]. Additionally, the model and its parameters require approval from the Board of Directors, which is a critical governance step [Page 2]. The methodology for estimating Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is explicitly stated to be in accordance with IFRS 9, particularly Point 5.5, confirming that the bank adheres to the necessary accounting standards [Page 1]. 

Furthermore, the classification of financial assets is updated monthly based on overdue payment conditions, which supports the dynamic assessment of credit risk [Page 5]. The Probability of Default (PD) is calculated using a model that incorporates various client-specific factors, ensuring a comprehensive risk assessment [Page 6]. The classification into stages based on the increase in credit risk since initial recognition is also in line with IFRS 9 requirements [Page 5].

3. [Fact 3] - There has been no Independent Validation of the model for estimating Expected Credit Losses (ECL). -> [Verified in Page 4]
4. [Fact 4] - The entity is in advanced negotiations with an external provider for model validation. -> [Verified in Page 5]
5. [Fact 5] - The validation process is expected to start soon, with a final report due in March 2026. -> [Verified in Page 5]
6. [Fact 6] - The methodology for estimating credit losses must align with IFRS 9 requirements. -> [Verified in Page 2]
7. [Fact 7] - The entity has committed to sending updated documentation and procedures after the Committee meeting in April 2026. -> [Verified in Page 5]";No, the condition is not met regarding the Independent Validation of the model for estimating Expected Credit Losses (ECL). While the model is required to be reviewed annually and approved by the Board of Directors [Fact 1, Fact 2], it has not yet undergone the necessary Independent Validation as mandated [Fact 3]. The entity is currently in advanced negotiations with an external provider to conduct this validation, which is expected to start soon, with a final report due in March 2026 [Fact 4, Fact 5]. Therefore, the validation process is still pending, and compliance with this requirement is not yet achieved.;8;The AI answer correctly identifies that the Independent Validation of the model for estimating Expected Credit Losses (ECL) has not been completed, which is supported by the context. However, it lacks specific details regarding the formal controls and procedures to ensure IFRS 9 methodologies are applied consistently and traceably, which were not explicitly addressed in the answer.
