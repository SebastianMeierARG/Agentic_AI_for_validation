It states that LGD is evaluated based on the behavior of credits in default concerning their recovery across different ranges of delinquency. Specifically, it mentions that credits in default are those with delays exceeding 90 days, and recovery is defined as 100% of the default balance for operations that register delays of less than 90 days in the following 12 months, along with capital reductions during that period. Any unrecovered balances after 12 months are considered losses [Page 12].\n\n2. **Exclusion of Guarantees**: The context also highlights that the decision to exclude guarantees from the LGD calculation is based on their low quantitative significance.

The main types of guarantees mentioned (e.g., fixed-term securities, discounted documents, mortgages, and pledges) represent marginal participations, which further supports the decision to exclude them from the LGD calculation [Page 1].\n\n3. **Prudential Approach**: The document emphasizes a prudential approach, stating that due to the lack of robust evidence demonstrating the mitigating effect of guarantees on loss, a conservative approach has been adopted, excluding guarantees from the LGD calculation until systemic and operational improvements justify their inclusion [Page 1].\n\n4. **Future Implementation**: There is a commitment to implement a forward-looking model for LGD, which will incorporate external variables affecting the time series being modeled.

        "AI_Answer": "**AUDITOR ANSWER:**\n\nThe audit query relates to the concept of \"Significant Increase in Credit Risk\" (SICR) as defined under IFRS 9, particularly in the context of the classification of financial assets into different stages based on their credit risk. \n\n1. **Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR):** The context provides a clear definition of SICR, stating that a financial operation is considered to have significantly increased credit risk when it is overdue by more than 30 days. This is a critical threshold for moving an asset to Stage 2 [Page 5].\n\n2. **Contagion Methodology:** The context also describes a \"contagion methodology\" where if one operation of a client is classified in Stage 2 or Stage 3, other operations of the same client may also be reclassified to the same stage, even if they do not meet the criteria independently. This approach allows for recognizing situations where partial deterioration indicates a greater risk at the client level [Page 3].\n\n3. **Additional Criteria for SICR:** The document outlines additional criteria for determining SICR, including the client's entry into bankruptcy proceedings or other legal restructuring forms, and adverse classifications in the Central Debtors system. These criteria will be included in the calculations starting from September 2025 [Page 3].\n\n4. **Implementation Responsibility:** The implementation of these criteria and methodologies is overseen by Marcela Buiguez from the Risk and Compliance Management department, with a commitment to send updated procedural manuals by October 31, 2025 [Page 3].\n\n5. **Review and Approval Process:** The context indicates that the model for estimating credit deterioration must be reviewed at least annually and approved by the Board, ensuring compliance with IFRS 9 requirements [Page 6].",

This condition is maintained over time according to the guidelines established in the \"Cura de Operaciones\" process [Page 5].\n\n3. **Contagion Methodology**: The methodology for \"contagio de stage\" (stage contagion) allows for the reclassification of other operations of the same client to a higher stage if one operation is classified in Stage 2 or Stage 3, even if they do not meet the criteria independently. This approach recognizes that partial deterioration may indicate a greater risk at the client level [Page 4].\n\n4. **External Signals**: The context also mentions that if a client presents a risk category higher than that used internally by the entity (e.g., category 3 or higher), they may be classified in Stage 2, even if their local obligations are current. This measure enhances the consolidated view of risk and incorporates external signals of deterioration [Page 3].\n\n5. **Implementation Timeline**: The implementation of these parameters is set to begin in September 2025, with a commitment to send updated documentation following a committee meeting on risk management [Page 3].",

The context provides a clear framework for this classification, detailing the criteria for Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3 assets.\n\n1. **Classification of Assets**: According to the context, assets are classified into three stages:\n   - **Stage 1**: Operations where credit risk has not significantly increased since initial recognition.\n   - **Stage 2**: Operations where credit risk has significantly increased since initial recognition.\n   - **Stage 3**: Operations that have recorded defaults, defined as operations with delays exceeding 90 days [Page 6].\n\n2. **Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR)**: The context mentions that the classification into Stage 2 requires an assessment of significant increases in credit risk, which is updated monthly based on the condition of arrears of all active operations [Page 5]. Additionally, it states that the classification of debtors in Stage 2 is based on a rebuttable presumption of 30 days of arrears, but it also emphasizes the need to incorporate additional elements beyond mere arrears to determine SICR, as per the guidelines in point B5.5.17 of IFRS 9 [Page 2].\n\n3. **Methodology for Estimating Probability of Default (PD)**: The context outlines that the methodology for estimating PD must reflect current economic conditions and should not assign a PD of 0% to any segment, as this would not comply with IFRS 9 requirements [Page 9]. The document also indicates that the estimation of credit losses must consider the possibility of credit loss even when the probability is very low [Page 9].\n\n4. **Implementation Responsibility**: The responsibility for implementing these classifications and methodologies lies with the Gerencia de Riesgos y Cumplimiento, specifically Marcela Buiguez, who is tasked with ensuring compliance with the established guidelines [Page 9].",
