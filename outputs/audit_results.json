        "AI_Answer": "**AUDITOR ANSWER:**\n\nThe audit query relates to the estimation of credit losses under IFRS 9, specifically focusing on the methodology for calculating Expected Credit Losses (ECL). The core banking concept here is the \"model development\" and \"estimation of credit losses,\" which includes the Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD), and the overall framework for assessing credit risk.\n\n1. **Model Development and Review**: The context indicates that both the Risk Management and Credit Risk Management departments are involved in developing the model for estimating the impairment of financial assets, ensuring compliance with IFRS 9, specifically Point 5.5. This model is reviewed at least annually or whenever significant events occur that may affect the adopted methodology [Page 2].\n\n2. **Approval Process**: The model for estimating credit losses, along with its parameters, must be approved by the Board of Directors, ensuring that there is a governance structure in place for oversight [Page 2].\n\n3. **Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD)**: The methodology for estimating PD is highlighted, indicating that it should reflect current economic conditions (point-in-time approach) and that a PD of 0% is not acceptable under IFRS 9, as losses must be recognized even with a very low probability of occurrence [Page 9]. The context also mentions that the ECL is calculated as the product of PD and LGD, which is a standard approach in credit risk modeling [Page 5].\n\n4. **Classification of Financial Assets**: The classification of financial assets into stages (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3) is clearly defined, with Stage 2 indicating a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, and Stage 3 indicating default [Page 6]. This classification is updated monthly based on the payment status of the operations.\n\n5. **Management Adjustments**: The context discusses the need for adjustments in the model to reflect the reality of credit risk, particularly in light of regulatory requirements and internal assessments [Page 7].\n\nIn summary, the audit evidence supports that the bank has established a comprehensive framework for estimating credit losses in compliance with IFRS 9, including model development, approval processes, and ongoing reviews.",

This model is reviewed at least annually or whenever significant events occur that may affect the adopted methodology [Page 3].\n\n2. **Independent Validation**: It is noted that an **Independent Validation** of the model for estimating Expected Credit Losses has not been carried out, which is a requirement according to the guidelines established in the **Basilea Committee** documentation [Page 4]. This lack of validation raises concerns regarding the reliability of the model used for estimating ECL.\n\n3. **Probability of Default (PD) Methodology**: The context specifies that the methodology for estimating PD must consider a complete economic cycle, but for Stage 1 under IFRS 9, a **point-in-time (PIT)** approach is required, reflecting current economic conditions. It is highlighted that an 8-year time window used in the calculations is excessive for the PIT approach mandated by the regulation [Page 7].\n\n4. **Expected Credit Losses (ECL) Discrepancies**: The document discusses discrepancies between the IFRS 9 provisions and regulatory norms, indicating that the IFRS 9 provisions are higher due to the PD being a higher percentage than the regulatory norm. This is particularly noted in segments such as **voluntary payment** and **credit cards**, where the IFRS provisions exceed the regulatory requirements by 236MM [Page 7].\n\n5. **Management Adjustments**: The context also mentions that the **Directorate** is responsible for approving the model and parameters used for estimating ECL, which indicates a level of management oversight and potential for adjustments based on expert judgment [Page 2].",

        "AI_Answer": "**AUDITOR ANSWER:**\n\nThe audit query relates to the classification and treatment of credit risk under IFRS 9, specifically focusing on the concepts of \"Incremento Significativo de Riesgo\" (Significant Increase in Credit Risk) and the stages of credit classification (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3). \n\n1. **Incremento Significativo de Riesgo (SICR)**: The context specifies that a credit exposure is considered to have significantly increased in risk when it has an overdue status of more than 30 days. This is crucial for the classification into Stage 2, which indicates a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition [Page 5].\n\n2. **Stage Classification**: The classification of credit exposures into stages is based on the risk assessment performed by the Credit Risk Area. The model used for this classification includes 10 criteria, with the first four variables accounting for 63% of the total score, indicating their importance in determining the credit risk level [Page 13]. The stages are defined as follows:\n   - **Stage 1**: No significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.\n   - **Stage 2**: Significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition.\n   - **Stage 3**: Default status, defined as an exposure that has been overdue for more than 90 days [Page 6].\n\n3. **Contagio de Clasificación (Classification Contagion)**: The context also describes a methodology for \"contagio de stage,\" where the classification of one operation can affect the classification of other operations of the same client. This is particularly relevant when a client has a deteriorated operation in a relevant segment, allowing for a broader assessment of risk across related exposures [Page 3].\n\n4. **Review and Approval Process**: The Gerencia de Riesgo Crediticio (Credit Risk Management) is responsible for participating in the development of the model for estimating credit deterioration, which must align with IFRS 9 requirements. This model is reviewed at least annually or whenever significant changes occur [Page 5].\n\n5. **Implementation Timeline**: The context mentions a commitment to send a procedural manual with updated calculations by October 31, 2025, indicating an ongoing effort to refine the credit risk assessment process [Page 3].",

The PD is calculated by averaging the last 36 historical default curves, which reflect the accumulated probabilities of default from a portfolio until its extinction [Page 8]. The current methodology emphasizes the number of individual cases rather than amounts, aligning with statistical principles that suggest observed frequencies can approximate real probabilities [Page 6].\n\n2. **Loss Given Default (LGD):** The LGD is determined by evaluating the behavior of credits in default concerning their recovery across different ranges of delinquency. Specifically, for operations that are in default for more than 90 days, a LGD of 100% is enforced to ensure full provisioning when the entity eventually moves the operation to Off-Balance Sheet Accounts [Page 12]. The calculation of LGD does not utilize the segmentation applied for PD but instead segments the default portfolio into Individual and Corporate portfolios [Page 12].\n\n3. **Forward-Looking Considerations:** The context mentions that the expected credit loss (ECL) is calculated using a forward-looking approach, which incorporates the forward-looking parameter (FL) in the PD calculation [Page 8]. \n\n4. **Cura de Operaciones:** The process of \"cura de operaciones\" allows for the migration of operations from higher to lower stages based on specific conditions, such as maintaining a delinquency of less than 31 days for consecutive months [Page 8]. \n\n5. **Implementation and Responsibility:** The implementation of the updated methodologies is scheduled for September 2025, with Marcela Buiguez from the Risk and Compliance Management department responsible for this implementation [Page 8].",

It is stated that this model should be reviewed at least annually or whenever events occur that could alter the adopted methodology [Page 2]. This aligns with the concept of model performance and validation, which is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of credit risk estimates.\n\n2. **Probability of Default (PD):** The methodology for estimating PD is based on historical default frequencies observed in similar segments, with a maximum analysis horizon of 60 months [Page 6]. This is consistent with the need for a robust PD estimation process that reflects current economic conditions, as required by IFRS 9.\n\n3. **Loss Given Default (LGD):** The context mentions the implementation of a prospective LGD model that incorporates external variables affecting the time series being modeled [Page 4]. This is essential for accurately reflecting future expected losses, which is a key requirement under IFRS 9.\n\n4. **Management Approval:** The context specifies that the expected credit loss amounts must be elevated to the Board for approval, ensuring that there is a governance structure in place for oversight of credit risk management [Page 2].\n\n5. **Independent Validation:** It is noted that an independent validation of the developed model for estimating Expected Credit Losses has not been carried out, which is a critical component of model governance and compliance with regulatory expectations [Page 4].",
