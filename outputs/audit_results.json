        "AI_Answer": "Yes, the context indicates that the methodology for estimating the Probability of Default (PD) is currently based on amounts rather than cases, which is not aligned with best practices. It is recommended to adjust this methodology to ensure accurate estimation of PD according to IFRS principles and international best practices [Fact 1, Fact 2]. The Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is calculated as the product of PD and the Loss Given Default (LGD), which is also defined in the context [Fact 3]. The classification of credit exposures is updated monthly based on the delinquency status, which is a necessary practice for effective credit risk management [Fact 4]. Furthermore, the context specifies that a LGD of 100% is enforced after 480 days of delinquency, indicating a robust approach to managing credit risk [Fact 5]. The total Exposure at Default (EAD) for revolving operations is clearly defined, which supports the calculation of ECL [Fact 6]. The classification into stages (Stage 1, Stage 2, and Stage 3) is also mentioned, which is essential for the ECL measurement process [Fact 7]. The involvement of the Credit Risk Management department in developing the impairment estimation model is noted, ensuring that the model aligns with regulatory requirements [Fact 8]. The methodology is set to be applied for determining adjustments for Expected Credit Losses on financial assets, indicating a structured approach to credit risk management [Fact 9].
